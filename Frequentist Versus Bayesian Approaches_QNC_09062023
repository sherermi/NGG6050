  %To be run in Matlab 

%% Exercise #1: 
% If someone gets a positive test, is it "statistically significant" at 
% the p<0.05 level? Why or why not?
    %No because the likelihood of getting a positive test result is 5% so 
    % the p value would need to be less than 0.05 to be statistically significant. 

%% Exercise #2: What is the probability that if someone gets a positive test, that person is infected?

% Assume a range of priors (infection rates) from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1.
prevalence_range = 0:0.1:1;

% Initialize an array to store the results
results = zeros(size(prevalence_range));

% Define the false positive rate of the test
false_positive_rate = 0.05;

% Loop through each prevalence rate
for i = 1:length(prevalence_range)
    prevalence = prevalence_range(i);
    
    % Calculate the probability of testing positive
    probability_positive = 1 * prevalence + false_positive_rate * (1 - prevalence);
    
    % Calculate the probability that someone who tests positive is actually infected
    probability_infected_given_positive = (1 * prevalence) / probability_positive;
    
    % Store the result in the results array
    results(i) = probability_infected_given_positive;
end

% Display the results
